shelljs.exec takes identical arguments ... `(command[, options])` ... but does not throw by default.

shelljs.exec has been benchmarked at 10 times faster than shelljs!

On success it returns a JSON object:

```javascript 1.5
TODO
```

On failure it returns a JSON object:

```javascript 1.5
TODO
```

For the full list of available options see [child_process.execSync](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_execsync_command_options)

**Author says**

But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 38 For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, 39 and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.

[Matthew 24:37-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A37-39&version=NKJV)
