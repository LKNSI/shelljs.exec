**Synchronous shell command execution, benchmark tests prove shell-o is much faster than the shelljs exec method**

**shell-o** is a wrapper for [child_process.execSync](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_execsync_command_options)

shell-o takes identical arguments ... `(command[, options])` ... but does not throw by default.

shell-o has been benchmarked at 10 times faster than shelljs!

On success it returns a JSON object:

```javascript 1.5
var shello = require('shell-o')
var cmd = 'echo hello'
var cmdObj = shello(cmd, {stdio: 'pipe', encoding:'utf-8'})

expect(cmdObj).to.eql({
  error: null, // same as child_process.exec
  stdout: 'hello\n',
  stderr: '', // same as child_process.exec
  code: 0,
  ok: true
})
```

On failure it returns a JSON object:

```javascript 1.5
var shello = require('shell-o')
var cmd = 'blip blop'
var cmdObj = shello(cmd, {stdio: 'pipe', encoding:'utf-8'})

expect(cmdObj.error).to.be.an('error')
expect(cmdObj.error.message).to.match(/not found|not recognized/)

expect(cmdObj.stdout).to.equal('')
expect(cmdObj.stderr).to.match(/not found|not recognized/)
expect(cmdObj.code).to.be.above(0)
expect(cmdObj.ok).to.be.false
```

**Author says**

But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 38 For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, 39 and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.

[Matthew 24:37-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A37-39&version=NKJV)
